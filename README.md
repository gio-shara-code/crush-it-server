# Crush it Server-Side

## Project Description

Crush-It is a workout builder which helps sportsmen build their workouts fast and train easily. In Crush-It you are able to select predefined workouts and create your own templates or select prefined workout templates. The user is of course able to create his own custom workout as well. Once you have created your custom workout or choosed one of our premade workouts, you are free to train.

## Project's aim

This is not a real-world project but the purpose of the project is to gain more technical knowledge in the fields of front-end and back-end. My project partner and me are doing it because we want to become very fast at building mvp's. So The only purpose of the project is to become better at building mvp's.

## Technologies

The technologies that we used are React (Frontend) and Node.js using express (Backend). As a database program we are using MongoDB.
- **Why React?** React does have several benefits in comparison to normal vanilla JS. First of all it makes the code more readable because of it's component-based structure. Additionally rendering content is faster in react because it uses techniques to minimize number of dom operations. Furthermore, testing is easier in react because it provides its own testing tools.

- **Why Node.js?** Again because it's popular and Node.js is usually good fit with React because you can work with both technologies in javascript/typescript.

- **Why MongoDB?** Particularly I want to get familiar with NoSQL database because I am planning to work in large projects in the future. I read that MongoDB is popular and therefore I thought it is a good fit for our project. But of course I am aware of the advantages and disadvantages of both SQL and NoSQL databases. It's just I had to choose between one of the databases so I went for NoSQL.
